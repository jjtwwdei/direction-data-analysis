# Introduction

## Examples
***
Wish to analyze data in which response is a “direction”:

  * 2d directional data are called *circular* data
  * 3d directional data are called *spherical* data
  * not all “directional” data are directions in the usual sense
  * “directional” data may also arise in higher dimensions
  
## Wind Directions
***
* Recorded at Col de la Roa, Italian Alps
* n = 310 (first 40 listed below)
* Radians, clockwise from north
* Source: Agostinelli (CSDA 2007); also R package `circular`

### Data



```{r eval=FALSE}
ascii(matrix(wind[1:40], ncol=5, byrow=TRUE), digits=2,
      include.rownames=FALSE, include.colnames=FALSE)
```



### Plot
```{r eval=FALSE}
require("circular")
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0)+0.1, oma=c(0,0,0,0)+0.1)
plot(windc, cex=1.5, axes=FALSE,
     bin=360, stack=TRUE, sep=0.035, shrink=1.3)
axis.circular(at=circular(seq(0, (7/4)*pi, pi/4),
                  template="geographics"),
              labels=c("N","NE","E","SE","S","SW","W","NW"),
              cex=1.4)
ticks.circular(circular(seq(0, (15/8)*pi, pi/8)),
               zero=pi/2, rotation="clock",
               tcl=0.075)

```




## Arrival Times at an ICU
***
* 24-hour clock times (format `hrs.mins`)
* n = 254 (first 32 listed below)
* Source: Cox & Lewis (1966); also Fisher (1993) and R package `circular`


### Data
```{r eval=FALSE}
ascii(matrix(fisherB1[1:32], ncol=4, byrow=TRUE), digits=2,
      include.rownames=FALSE, include.colnames=FALSE)

```

### Plot

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Note that pch=17 does not work properly here.
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0)+0.1, oma=c(0,0,0,0)+0.1)
plot(fisherB1c, cex=1.5, axes=TRUE,
     bin=360, stack=TRUE, sep=0.035, shrink=1.3)

## Butterfly Migrations
***
* Direction of travel observed for 2649 migrating butterflies in Florida
* Source: Thomas J Walker, University of Florida, Dept of Entomology and Nematology
* Other variables:
    + site: 23 locations in Florida
    + observer: Thomas Walker (tw) or James J. Whitesell (jw)
    + species: cloudless sulphur (cs), gulf fritillary (gf), long-tailed skipper (lt)
    + distance to coast (km)
    + date and time of observation
    + percentage of sky free of clouds
    + quality of sunlight: (b)right, (h)aze, (o)bstructed, (p)artly obstructed
    + presence/absence and direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) of wind
    + temperature
    
## Why is the Analysis of Directional Data Different?
***
* First three observations from the wind directions data: src_R{paste(round(wind[1:3], 2), collapse=”, “)}
* The mean of these three numbers is src_R{round(mean(wind[1:3]), 2)} {{{results(`2.47`)}}}
* What do you think?


# Graphical Display of Directional Data
***

## Graphical Display of Circular Data (in R)
***

* Have already seen simple dot plots for circular data, e.g., for the wind data:


## Graphical Display of Circular Data (in R) (ctd)
***
* and for the ICU data:

* and one more ...

## Circular Histograms
***
* [Circular histograms](https://www.google.com/search?q=R+circular+histogram) exist (see Fisher and Mardia and Jupp) but is there a ready-made function in R?


## Rose Diagrams
***
* Invented by [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale) (elected first female member of the Royals Statistical Society in 1859; honorary member of ASA)
* [Nightingale’s rose in R](https://github.com/jennybc/r-graph-catalog/tree/master/figures/fig05-14_nightingale-data) (see also this [post](http://www.r-bloggers.com/going-beyond-florence-nightingales-data-diagram-did-flo-blow-it-with-wedges/) and the [R graph catalog](http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/))
* Note that radii of segments are proportional to square root of the frequencies (counts), so that areas are proportional to frequencies. Is this the right thing to do?
* Rose diagrams suffer from the same problems as histograms. The impression conveyed may depend strongly on:
    + the binwidth of the cells
    + the choice of starting point for the bins

## Adding a Rose Diagram to the Plot of Wind Directions
***

```{r eval=FALSE}
rose.diag(windc, bins=16, col="darkgrey",
          cex=1.5, prop=1.35, add=TRUE)

```

## Changing the Binwidth
***
### Fewer/Wider Bins

### Narrow Bins

## Changing the Radii
***
* I think that the default “radii proportional to counts” is generally best, but this is not always obvious. The scale certainly makes a big difference however.
```{r eval=FALSE}
rose.diag(windc, bins=16, col="darkgrey",
          radii.scale="linear",
          cex=1.5, prop=2.4, add=TRUE)


```

## Kernel Density Estimates
***
```{r eval=FALSE}
lines(density.circular(windc, bw=40), lwd=2, lty=1)
Kernel Density Estimates
```


## Spherical Data
***
* Are there any canned routines for plotting spherical data in R?

# Basic Summary Statistics
***
## Mean Direction and Mean Resultant Length
***
* First three observations from the wind directions data:
* resultant (sum of direction vectors): (src_R{round(xsum, 3)}, src_R{round(ysum, 3)})
* mean vector: \((\bar{x}, \bar{y}) = \) (src_R{round(xbar, 3)}, src_R{round(ybar, 3)})
* resultant length (Euclidean norm of resultant): R = src_R{round(resultantLength, 3)}
* mean resultant length: \(\bar{R} = \) src_R{round(meanResultantLength, 3)}
* mean direction: \((\bar{x}, \bar{y})/\bar{R} = \) (src_R{round(meanDirection[1], 3)}, src_R{round(meanDirection[2], 3)})
* \(˜{θ} = \) src_R{round(meanDirectionRadians, 3)}

# Aside: Generating from the Uniform Distribution on the Sphere
***
## Generating Random Points on the Sphere
***

* Wish to generate a random “direction” in d-dimensions; i.e., an observation from the uniform distribution in the \(d-1\) sphere.
* Usual way: let X ∼ N_d(0, I) and return U = X/||X||.
* An alternative rejection sampler:
      + Repeat until ||X|| <= 1
      + Let X be uniformly distributed on the cube [-1,1]^d
      + Return U = X/||X||
* What is the acceptance rate for the rejection sampler:
      + Volume of the \(d - 1\) sphere is \(πd/2/Γ(d/2 + 1)\)
      + Volume of [-1,1]^d is 2^d
      + Acceptance rate is \((π1/2/2)^d/Γ(d/2 + 1)\)
      + Curse of dimensionality
        
## Code for Timing Results
***

```{r eval=FALSE}
runifSphere <- function(n, dimension, method=c("norm", "cube", "slownorm")) {
    method <- match.arg(method)
    if (method=="norm") {
        u <- matrix(rnorm(n*dimension), ncol=dimension)
        u <- sweep(u, 1, sqrt(apply(u*u, 1, sum)), "/")
    } else if (method=="slownorm") {
        u <- matrix(nrow=n, ncol=dimension)
        for (i in 1:n) {
            x <- rnorm(dimension)
            xnorm <- sqrt(sum(x^2))
            u[i,] <- x/xnorm
        }
    } else {
        u <- matrix(nrow=n, ncol=dimension)
        for (i in 1:n) {
            x <- runif(dimension, -1, 1)
            xnorm <- sqrt(sum(x^2))
            while (xnorm > 1) {
                x <- runif(dimension, -1, 1)
                xnorm <- sqrt(sum(x^2))
            }
            u[i,] <- x/xnorm
        }
    }
    u
}

```

## Easy fix for Borel’s paradox in 3-d
***
Take longitude \(φ ∼ U(0,2π)\) independent of latitude \(θ = arcsin(2U-1)\), \(U ∼ U(0,1)\).

# Rotationally Symmetric Distributions
***
## Comparison of Projected Normal and Langevin Distributions
***

One way that we might compare the \(\nlangevin(μ, κ)\) and \(\npn(γ\mu, I)\) distributions by choosing κ and γ to give the same mean resultant lengths and comparing the densities of the cosine of the angle θ between \(U\) and \(μ\).

Of course matching mean resultant lengths is not necessarily the best way to compare these families of distributions.
